# NEAT-Implementation-for-Asteroids-Game
I designed a ship to play the game asteroids to compete in a class competition. The ship was used by the asteroids game framework built by my professor, (from which I will not be including, for it is a reused bi-annual assignment). I will provide my implementation for the ship I designed using Neuro Evolution for Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) and a genetic algorithm that I used to find an optimal ship to use in the competition.
## UPDATES COMMING SOON!
* code is on my computer that got sent in for hard drive failure and is currently being extracted!
